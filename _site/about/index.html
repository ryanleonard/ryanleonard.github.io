<p><span class="image right"><img src="/images/about_headshot.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>

<p>My name is Ryan Leonard, and I am currently using my knowledge of Robotics, AI, and Computer Vision to make the world more accessible to individuals with severe physical disabilities. My first project since completing grad school, is a semi autonomous wheelchair that can be guided using only your eyes. Using my interface, the user simply expresses their intent to move to a location, and the wheelchair takes care of the navigation and obstacle avoidance tasks. When I am not working, I enjoy reading up on the latest technological breakthroughs, exploring the Colorado outdoors with my dog Milo, and playing various video games.</p>

<h3 id="my-background">My Background</h3>
<div class="box">
  <p>
    I have a very diverse educational background. While I was still in high school, I worked in a behavioral neuroscience lab at CU studying the effects of stress and circadian rhythm. I spent the first two years of my college education studying Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, but when I discovered that I was learning the breakthroughs of 60 years ago, rather than the cutting edge, I decided to switch my major to applied mathematics. 
</p>
<p>
    As I was completing my degree, I became exposed to the world of robotics and computer vision, and helped CU compete in multiple national and international robotics competitions. The summer after I graduated, I taught myself Tensorflow and the fundamentals of deep learning, which lead me to my first job as a data scientist at Welltok, a health optimization company. Here, I worked with a team of data scientists and medical coding experts to create a consumer facing chat bot to help users better navigate the convoluted healthcare system.
</p>
<p>
    Over the course of the year I worked at Welltok, I realized that I missed the diverse set of challenges that I confronted during my brief experience working with robotics, which led me to continue my education as a graduate student at CU Boulder. Prior to even being accepted into the program, I quit my job and started working in the Intelligent Robotics Lab as a research assistant while getting a head start on my degree through the continuing education program.
</p>
<p>
    Upon being accepted into the program, I completed all of my course requirements in under a year while independently studying advanced topics in Computer Vision, Simulation, and Deep Learning. After I completed my degree, I reflected on my time at CU, and found that I became more preoccupied with course work than learning the material I came back to school to learn in the first place. This led me to a conflicted choice of pursuing a PhD to pursue more targeted research, or re-entering the workforce. I decided to take some time to consider a decision by working part time as a graphics course manager while I researched some more advanced topics independently. During this time, I came up with a number of interesting ideas which could be pursued both in academia and in industry.

<h3 id="now">Now</h3>
<p>I am currently working independently to develop a semi-autonomous wheelchair to help individuals with severe physical disabilities, such as Stephen Hawking or Christopher Reeve better navigate and interact with the world. I built a new user interface and custom gazetracking tool which allows the user to navigate the world using only their eyes. Feel free to check out this project in more detail on my projects page!</p>
