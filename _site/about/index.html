<p><span class="image right"><img src="/images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>

<p>My name is Ryan Leonard, and I am currently using my knowledge of Robotics, AI, and Computer Vision to make the world more accessible to those with disabilities. My first product, is a semi autonomous wheelchair that can be guided using only your eyes. When I am not working, I enjoy reading up on the latest technological breakthroughs, enjoying the Colorado outdoors with my dog Milo, and daydreaming about the future. </p>

<h3 id="content-is-imortant">My Background</h3>
<div class="box">
  <p>
  I have a very diverse educational background. I started college working in a behavioral neuroscience lab while pursuing a double major in Molecular Biology and Biochemistry. At the end of my sophomore year, I was on the verge of completing both majors by the end of my 3rd year, when I decided to pursue a path which required more critical thinking in Applied Mathematics. As I worked my way through my courses, I discovered the pleasures of (and many frustrations) of software development, and the power it gave me to actually implement my ideas. After 3 years, received my B.S. in applied mathematics with a minor in Computer Science, achieving a 3.3 GPA.
  </p>
  <p>
  While wrapping up my undergraduate degree, I participated in an independent study with Prof. Nikolaus Correll, where I worked with a small team of graduate and undergraduate students on delivery systems using the Dr. Robot Jaguar. This project eventually led to us competing in the NASA Robotic Mining competition in May 2016. 
</p>
<p>
After graduation, I temporarily put off searching for work to help CU compete in the RoboSub competition. For this competition, I worked on building a simulation environment in Gazebo, and helped with various computer vision tasks. In what free time I had, I also taught myself machine learning and Tensorflow. 
</p>
<p>

  Once this competition concluded, I received an internship at Welltok where I worked as a Data Scientist/Data Engineer. Upon completing this internship, remained at Welltok as a full time employee. Despite enjoying my work, I missed working with my hands and found myself continuing to work on computer vision projects in my free time. After a year working professionally, I decided to go back to Graduate school to pursue my interests more seriously. 
</p>
<p>
  I recently finished my Master's degree in Computer Science at CU Boulder, where I earned a 3.94 GPA. I worked on various projects ranging from the calibration of robotic arms, Computer Vision systems for hydrology surveys, policy elicitation in collaborative agents, and advanced simulation environments using Unity 3D and Unreal Engine.

<h3 id="content-is-imortant">Right Now</h3>

<p><span class="image left"><img src="/images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>

<p>Right now, I am independently working to create a semi autonomous wheelchair for individuals who lack the function of their arms and legs. The robotics revolution is at hand, and it appears that a majority of the focus of this field is on assembly, self driving vehicles, and various military applications. </p>
<p>
  While the advent of these (semi) intelligent machines will have modest impacts on our everyday lives, I believe that for people suffering through debilitating illness and injury, these advances can be truly transformative. For example, for those of you familiar with breaking bad, (TODO: add a link to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWso-qRaIlM) Stephen Hawking could only communicate using a virtual letter board as shown in this link. Moreover, he was entirely dependent on a caregiver to take him wherever he needed to go. My tools would have allowed him to type out words in real time, simply by looking at letters on a virtual keyboard. Moreover, they would have allowed him to travel as far as his wheelchair battery could carry him using a natural interface controlled by his eyes.
