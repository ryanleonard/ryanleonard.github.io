								<h5>Im Ryan Leonard, a Robotics Engineer working to build a future where humans and robots work together.</h5>
				<p>I recently finished my masters degree in computer science at CU. Over the past couple months, I built out my first prototype of a semi-autonomous wheelchair that you can control with your eyes. As I continue development of the software for my platform, I am looking for investors in this technology so that I can improve the lives of people suffering from severe paralysis and other disabilities. </p>
				
				<p>My goal is currently to continue developing ethical uses for robotics and artificial intelligence, and I am interested in meeting others who share these principles. If, as you explore my website, any content stands out to you, or you wish to collaborate on a new project or startup, please feel free to reach out to me below.</p>
