								<h3>I'm a Robotics Engineer working to build a future where humans and robots work together.</h3>
				<p>I recently finished my Masters degree in Computer Science at CU. Over the past few months, I built a proof of concept semi-autonomous wheelchair that you can control with your eyes. As I continue development of this platform, I am looking for collaborators and investors who are interested in enhancing this technology in order to improve people's lives.</p>
				
				<p></p>

				<p>My goal is currently to continue developing ethical uses for robotics and artificial intelligence, and I am interested in meeting others who share these principles. If any content stands out to you as you explore my website, or you wish to collaborate on a new project or startup, please feel free to reach out to me below.</p>
