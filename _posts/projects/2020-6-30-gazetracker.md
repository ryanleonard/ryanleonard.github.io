## Motivation
To the best of my knowledge, there are few existing solutions which allow disabled individuals to interact with technology. In the extreme case, someone with complete paralysis such as stephen hawking is unable to interact with any technology except for his expensive wheelchair. 

I created a gazetracking solution that I believe can work with any webcam, and can directly predict which pixel you are looking at down to approximately a 1cm radius (on a 15 inch computer monitor). If this level of accuracy is not enough, I added an interface which allows you to fine tune the position of a computer cursor to any position on the screen.

I am also in the process of exploring how this technology can be used to improve reaction time and accuracy for online gaming.

## Everything Else
For a better description of the features of this tool, please check out the attached youtube video below. As I am currently planning on using this technology to develop a commercial wheelchair, I am hesitant to share the details of my implementation.
