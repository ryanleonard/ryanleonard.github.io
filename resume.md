# Ryan's Resume
Description:
I am a self driven software engineer who frequently comes up with unique ideas and has the ability to implement them. I have proven through a large variety of projects that I am capable of teaching myself technically complicated material, and stellar teaching reviews have shown that I am capable of also communicating technical concepts to others. 

### Education
Masters in Computer Science 2017-2019 GPA 3.94
Classes include: 
Machine Learning, Graphics, Computational Genomics, Algorithmic Human Robot Interaction, Statistical Estimation of Dynamic Systems, Network Analysis and Modelling (Basically graph theory for computer scientists)

Bachelors in Applied Mathematics 2011-2016
Completed Degree in applied mathematics with minor in computer science after switching majors from Molecular Biology and Biochemistry at the end of my second year. My areas of emphasis focused on numerical computing, probability, and statistics.


### Work Experience 
Graphics Course Manager/TA: August 2019-December 2019
Taught students how to use OpenGL (freeglut) to create visually complex scenes. Topics in this course included lighting, shaders, and linear algebra. For many students, this was their first course where they were responsible for creating a large code base from scratch. I was able to help many of them develop good practices for designing their code and debugging.

Physics TA: January 2019 - May 2019
Responsible for teaching approximately 150 students classical mechanics. Restructured the way that the course was taught to engage students in active discussions and more efficiently cover the material within the span of a class. The professor in charge of teaching the class had me teach my methods to other TA's and make them a standard going forward.

Research Assistant: August 2017 - December 2019
Worked in multiple robotics labs at CU. Built a computer vision based hydrology survey tool, built an easily extensible, dynamic gridworld simulation environment from scratch. Assisted other graduate students with the development of deep learning models for robotic manipulation. Currently in the process of publishing a paper to AAAI 2021.

Data Scientist at Welltok October 2016 - September 2017
Aided in the development of natural language models for a consumer facing chatbot. Created a data processing user interface medical coding experts, which accelerated our chatbot's ability to process conflicting terminology between different healthcare providers.

Robosub: Summer 2016 and Summer 2017
Helped CU compete in two Robosub competitions by developing computer vision algorithms for underwater obstacle detection and avoidance. Started development of a Gazebo based simulation environment to allow the software team to develop algorithms while the physical robot was being modified and repaired.

NASA Robotic Mining Competition: Spring 2016
Helped the CU Robotics club develop hardware and software for the NASA Robotic Mining competition.


### Languages:
C/C++, Python, C#

### Technologies:
ROS, OpenCV, PCL, Pytorch, Tensorflow 2.0, CUDA, Open3D, Qt, OpenGL/freeglut, Git, Python Science Stack: Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, etc..., 

### Interesting Projects
Notable projects include Semi autonomous wheelchair, Gazetracking system, SPEAR, Smart Vent. For more projects, See my projects page!
