# Ryan's Resume
## Description
I am a self driven software engineer who frequently comes up with unique ideas and has the ability to implement them. I have proven through a large variety of projects that I am capable of teaching myself technically complicated material, and stellar teaching reviews have shown that I am capable of also communicating technical concepts to others. 

## Education
#### Masters in Computer Science: 2018-2019 GPA 3.94  
Courses include: 
Machine Learning, Graphics, Algorithmic Human Robot Interaction, Probabilistic Modeling, Statistical Estimation of Dynamic Systems, and Network Analysis  
Developed Computer Vision based tools for conducting Hydrology Surveys
Helped develop a novel SPEAR algorithm for policy elicitation between mulitple human and/or autonomous agents. Publication to be submitted to AAAI 2021

#### Bachelors in Applied Mathematics: 2011-2016 GPA 3.3  
Completed a degree in applied mathematics with a minor in computer science. Courses include Mathematical Statistics, Applied Analysis, Partial Differential Equations, Differential Equations, Markov Processes, Numerical Analysis, Complex Variables, Operating Systems, Computer Vision, and Intro to Artificial Intelligence

## Work Experience 
#### R&D Robotics Engineer: February 2020 - Present  
Built a novel gazetracking tool from scratch using Pytorch, OpenCV, and Qt. Designed and 3D printed a custom control interface for most powered wheelchairs and includes sensor housing. Using ROS, C++ and Python, implemented control and navigation algorithms for navigating a semi-autonomous wheelchair around obstacles. Using Unity3D built a custom simulation environment with ROS integration, as well as depth and instance segmentation shaders which allow for efficient and accurate generation of training data for neural networks and other robotics applications.

#### Research Assistant: August 2017 - December 2019  
Worked in multiple robotics labs at CU. Built a computer vision based hydrology survey tool, built an easily extensible, dynamic gridworld simulation environment from scratch. Collaborated with other graduate students on the subjects of Human Robot Interaction, Robotic Manipulation, and Simulation. Currently in the process of publishing a paper to AAAI 2021.

#### Graphics Course Manager/TA: August 2019-December 2019   
Taught students how to use OpenGL (freeglut) to create visually complex scenes. Topics in this course included lighting, shaders, and linear algebra. For many students, this was their first course where they were responsible for creating a large code base from scratch. I was able to help many of them develop good practices for designing their code and debugging

#### Physics TA: January 2019 - May 2019  
Responsible for teaching approximately 150 students classical mechanics. Restructured the way that the course was taught to engage students in active discussions and more efficiently cover the material within the span of a class period. The professor in charge of teaching the class had me teach my methods to other TA's and make them a standard going forward.

#### Data Scientist at Welltok: October 2016 - September 2017  
Aided in the development of natural language models for a consumer facing chatbot. Created a data processing user interface medical coding experts, which accelerated our chatbot's ability to process conflicting terminology between different healthcare providers.

#### Robosub: Summer 2016 and Summer 2017  
Helped CU compete in two Robosub competitions by developing computer vision algorithms for underwater obstacle detection and avoidance. Started development of a Gazebo based simulation environment to allow the software team to develop algorithms while the physical robot was being modified and repaired.

#### NASA Robotic Mining Competition: Spring 2016  
Helped the CU Robotics club develop hardware and software for the NASA Robotic Mining competition.
